# Writer
Clean, extremely simple writing tool for developers.

## Purpose
After scouting the web, I could not find a blogging tool as simple as clean as I was searching for. Most of the tools contain lots of - for me - unnecessary features, which inspired me to write my own tool. Hence, Writer was born.

## Goal
Writer is intended to be used by me and my friend while backpacking in South-East Asia in 2017. We're going away for six months and I thought it would be awesome to document our trip using a blog. It will therefore probably be heavily customized for personal use.

# Features
* Designed mobile-first, since we won't bring computers on our trip. Mobility is key.
* Markdown support. Being able to write Markdown in posts is insanely sweet.
* Attaching images to each post, to be displayed in a gallery at the end of each post.
* Categories will be implemented.
* Writer will also support multiple users.
* Integration with Facebook and possibly Twitter. Automatically share all posts to Facebook.

# Timeline
As long as it is completed and deployed prior to our trip. No need to rush it.
