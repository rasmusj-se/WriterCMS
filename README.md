# Writer
Clean, extremely simple writing tool for developers.

## Purpose
After scouting the web, I could not find a blogging tool as simple as clean as I was searching for. Most of the tools contain lots of - for me - unnecessary features, which inspired me to write my own tool. Hence, Writer was born.

## Goal
Writer is intended to be used by me and my friend while backpacking in South-East Asia in 2017. We're going away for six months and I thought it would be awesome to document our trip using a blog. It will therefore probably be heavily customized for personal use.

# Features
- [x] Markdown support. Writing posts in Markdown is awesome.
- [x] Attaching images to posts, which are later displayed in a gallery in post details.
- [x] Categories
- [ ] Making it possible for readers to comment on posts.
- [ ] Facebook (and possibly Twitter) integration, to enable auto-sharing.

# Timeline
As long as it is completed and deployed prior to our trip. No need to rush it.
